## Getting Started
My Journey to learning NextJS.

This project is a practical demonstration of my learning journey with Next.js. It showcases my ability to integrate various tools and technologies to build a fully functional e-commerce website.

## Technologies used in the website
    -   NextJS
    -   React
    -   Javascript
    -   CSS
    -   Sanity CMS (Content Management System for backend)
    -   Context API (for state management)
    -   Stripe Payments (secure online payments)

## Functionality in the E-Commerce website
    -   Full E-Commerce Functionality: Users can filter products, add them to the cart, proceed to checkout, and complete payments securely via Stripe and includes shipping costs.
    -   Responsive design: The website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing a smooth experience across devices.

## Test card information
To simulate payments, use the following test card details in all fields:\
4242 4242 4242 4242 for all fields on the card â€” for expiry date you can use years that have not yet expired eg 04/27, , can use any name and email for the card information
